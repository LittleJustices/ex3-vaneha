So it turns out there was an extra paragraph or so in the old corebook leak that didn't make it into the final release which described the sacred mountain Ama-Ni-Traya as a geomantic nexus and hinted at a clique of celestial gods taking it over long ago from the terrestrial spirit court that had been squatting in those manses surviving the fall of the first age

This celestial clique is more properly and respectfully known as the Ninety-Nine Stars, so if there is a tutelary deity of the imperial family in particular, I think it is The First and Hundredth, whose personal name may only be spoken and heard by their priesthood. I don't know if there are literally 99 of them, but assuming one god to one clan, it's probably within the ballpark if each clan's domain is of reasonably manageable size

I'm not going to define every single one of those of course. If any players happen to be lore-inclined that's fertile ground for introducing facts. Or for defining what clan you're from during character creation assuming you're vanehan

Even if it was exactly 99 to begin with odds aren't bad that the number has fluctuated since
